Hello and Welcome to my GitHub!  

Here you can see some of my previous coding experience mostly from classes.  If you haven't already done so, check out my website www.josephoconnell.page

On my website you can read about my experience and qualifications.

Please check out my repos organized by class.  I will be continually adding descriptions to projects so it is easier to find specific experience.  If you are curious if I have experience in a particular area or language, feel free to send me a message!

Joe
